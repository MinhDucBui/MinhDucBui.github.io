Hi, my name is Minh Duc Bui, you can call me Duc! I'm a PhD student at JGU Mainz, advised by Katharina von der Wense. My research focuses on analyzing and developing techniques for resource efficiency, fairness and their intersection in NLP models. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree in "Mathematics in Business and Economics", and subsequently pursued a master's degree in "Data Science" with a strong emphasis on NLP at the university of Mannheim. Following the completion of my master's degree, I transitioned into the industry, where I worked as a data scientist in the autonomous driving field in Stuttgart.
