Hi, my name is **Minh Duc Bui**, you can call me Duc! I'm a PhD student at JGU Mainz, advised by **Katharina von der Wense (nÃ¨e Kann)**. My research focuses on analyzing and developing techniques for **resource efficiency, fairness** and their **intersection in NLP models**. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor's degree in "Mathematics in Business and Economics", and subsequently pursued a master's degree in "Data Science" with a strong emphasis on NLP at the university of Mannheim. Following the completion of my master's degree, I transitioned into the industry, where I worked as a data scientist in the autonomous driving field in Stuttgart.
